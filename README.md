# EC_Data_Extraction

A project to extract EC voter data from pdf. We hope to overlay the data with gps cordinates of the various constituencies. This will help us perform some basic analysis of names in the various regions and constituencies. 
Will we be able to tell the immigration trend in the data based on the face that some names are usually associated with specific regions?
Which regions have the very elderly registering to vote?
Which regions have the youngest set of voters participating in the excercise? 
Is there a relationship between the place of registration of younger voter population and the locations of senior secondary schools?
These are just a few of the numerous questions we seek to answer with this data.

Well, lets see how this plays out.........
You are invited to join in.


## Features Developed
- Table extraction (Does not include first design page)

## Features To Developed
- Check for accuracy of total number of tables extracted
- Table formatting (Next phase to work on - to use pandas library)
- Importation of data into database (After cleansing is done)
- Getting gps cordinates of capital cities for mapping
- Getting gps cordinates for inidividual constituencies

## Quick start

- "My_Local_Folder_Path" was created and imported to abstract local folder path. You will need to set up a python file called "My_Local_Folder_Path" in the root directory of the code or you can choose to delete the "import My_Local_Folder_Path" line of code and assign the "root_dir" to your input file folder path and also assign same for the output folder path.
